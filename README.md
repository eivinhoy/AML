# AML-COURSE
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the Algorithmic Machine Learning Course at Eurecom. This is a fork of the original repository with @https://github.com/yohannjs and my solutions to the different problems. 

## Objectives of the course
The goal of this course is mainly to offer data science projects to students to gain hands-on experience. It nicely merges the theoretical concepts students can learn in our courses on machine learning and statistical inference, and systems concepts we teach in distributed systems.

## Tasks
- Music Recommender system based on data from last.fm
- House pricing prediction based on data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/
- Plankton taxonomy classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Anomaly detection 

## Technical notes
All tasks where done on the EURECOM cloud computing platform, on a cluster managed by [Zoe](http://zoe-analytics.eu/), which is a container-based analytics-as-a-service built by the Data Science department at EURECOM. 

## Sources and acknowledgments
Some of the Notebooks used in the course are based on use cases illustrated in the book [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do), by Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen & Josh Wills.
